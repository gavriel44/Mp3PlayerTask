<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![project main front](./readMeImages/project_front.jpg?raw=true 'project_front')

This is my solution for the MP3 Player - Second Weekend Assignment.

In this project I implement a MP3 player that can perform different tasks
and will help you menage your music. In addition to managing your music you can also
use the web app interface and visualize what is happening while adding or removing songs.

And last but not least: In the interface feel free to press the INFO button, this will use
the lost.fm api to fetch information on <strong>every</strong> artist you can think off!!! try me ;)

<strong>U can try my project right now, got to github-pages:</strong> [https://gavriel44.github.io/Mp3PlayerTask/](https://gavriel44.github.io/Mp3PlayerTask/)
