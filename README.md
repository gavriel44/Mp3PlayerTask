<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![project main front](./readMeImages/project_front.jpg?raw=true "project_front")

This is my solution for the MP3 Player - Second Weekend Assignment.

In this project I implement a MP3 player that can perform different tasks
and will help you menage your music. In addition to managing your music you can also
use the web app interface and visualize what is happening while adding or removing songs.

And last but not least: In the interface feel free to press the INFO button, this will use
the lost.fm api to fetch information on <strong>every</strong> artist you can think off!!! try me ;)

### Important Files You Should Notice

* index.js - the main Requirements for the project

* scripts.js - the personal js code <strong>I</strong> added for index.html
* index.html - the template for the web page i.e the user interface for the player
* styles.css - the css for index.html

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

* clone the project
* ```npm install``` in the cmd
* open the index.html file in the browser. <strong>I recommend using Live server for that</strong>
